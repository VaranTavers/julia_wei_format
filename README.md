# WeightedEdgeListFormat
A small package that I needed for multiple Pluto.jl projects and wanted to access easily.

Doesn't support:

  * Loading multiple graphs from the same file

  * Assigning names to graphs

## v. 0.2.0

Adds support for writing graphs.

Changes from CSV.jl to DelimitedFiles.jl
